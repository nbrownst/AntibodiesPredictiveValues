# AntibodiesPredictiveValues

#These files include code and tables required to reproduce the calculations in our accompanying paper.

#The file "Code3Dplots.R" produces Figures 1 and 2, general plots of PPV and NPV for reasonable ranges of antibodies tests
#The resulting plots can be viewed in interactive mode. The axes can be rotated to better understand relationships between variables.

#The file "FDAtestsandLocations.R" calculates the PPV and false positive rates for tests operating under an Emergency Use Authorization
#This is the information calculated for Table 1 and Figures 3 and 4
#The file also calculates PPV plots and calculations for the case studies

#The file "formattedTestsMay23.csv" contains input information on sensitivity/specificity for EUA tests.
#This file is needed to run "FDAtestsandLocations.R"

#The file "SensitivityAnalysis.R" accompanies the supplementary material, which includes a sensitivity analysis calculating 
#effects on results using estimated prevalence from the positive testing rate in the case studies in New York and Chelsea, MA
